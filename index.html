        <div class="sub__title">
          <p>
            An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in
            horror.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of
            the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares,
            others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that
            aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

            Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
            Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
            recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

              A darker, maybe better take on The Good Son. The pacing can be
              glacial at times, but it is a story about a bored child’s
              fascination with death, so I think it’s forgivable. A lot of
              people compare it to Psycho, but I don’t see it at all. The only
              real overlap is that it focuses on a disturbed boy living at a
              motel with a parent. Oh, I’m adding a “creepy kid” filter for this
              film.

              I’ve written before about the Saturday Nightmares Series the USA
              Network ran in the ’80s. That series would feature one
              Horror/Thriller film from 8pm to 10pm, then either The Twilight
              Zone, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, or Alfred Hitchcock Presents from
              10pm to 11pm. I watched the three-hour block religiously and
              attribute my early love for Horror to this series. I can also
              credit the series with the many nights I slept on our itchy couch
              because I was too afraid to make the dangerous trek from the
              living room to my bedroom in the dark. There are a few episodes of
              The Alfred Hitchcock Hour that stuck with me, An Unlocked Window
              being my favorite. It’s a quintessential
              creepy-old-house-in-a-storm tale with a twist. Two other episodes
              I remember really loving are Where the Woodbine Twineth (season 3,
              episode 13) and Final Escape (season 2, episode 18). The former
              being about an orphan with a not-so-imaginary friend, and the
              latter being about a convict in a state prison that concocts a
              terrifying plan of escape (also featuring a genius twist). Check
              them out!!

              When I was little and we were watching a movie, if a scene came up
              that was maybe a little too risqué for a child my parents would
              say, “Bub… go to the closet!” (Oh the irony.) It really meant just
              to cover my eyes, but of course I wouldn’t do a great job of it,
              and sometimes I’d see a little something and think, “What’s the
              big deal?” I remember us starting Dressed to Kill and having to
              “go to the closet” several times in just the first 10–15 minutes
              or so, then they stopped the video altogether and we never
              finished, although I did later catch my brother looking at the
              shower scene again (he would also get very close to the TV when
              the Prell shampoo commercials with the lady showering came on and
              press his face to the screen to try and see if he could look down
              into the TV and see her boobs). This of course piqued my interest
              greatly and made this forbidden film one I would later seek out
              the moment I turned 18 and could rent it myself. Brian De Palma
              mastered the art of suspense with many of his early films. He also
              mastered the art of sneaking soft-core porn into his occasionally
              above average Thrillers (taking it to a near meta level with his
              problematic 1984 film Body Double). Dressed to Kill begins with a
              three-minute pornographic take on the shower scene from Psycho
              featuring actor Angie Dickinson working up a lather (paying extra
              close attention to her breasts and vagina, of course), then being
              raped in front of her husband by a phantom assailant, and finally
              cuts to said husband using her to get off while she struggles
              underneath him. I’m sure you can see why a lot of people hold
              issue with the film. It continues to face accusations of misogyny
              and transphobia to this day. My teenage brain of course didn’t put
              any of that together. Watching it today, it’s impossible to ignore
              the aforementioned issues, but rather than ignore it or cast it
              aside, I think we can consider it a benchmark to see just how far
              we’ve come in such a short time. Like so many movies from decades
              past, its warts are on full, unabashed display, but does that make
              it a bad film? I’d love to hear what you think.
